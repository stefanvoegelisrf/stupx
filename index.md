### Motor types
Below is a list of the relevant motor types for this module.

#### Stepper Motor
- **Targeted Position**: Stepper motors move in discrete steps, allowing precise control of the angular position. They are often used in applications requiring accurate positioning and repeatability. A recent advancement includes a low-consumption stepper motor controller that can respond in real-time to target position changes, which is particularly useful in precision measurement and manufacturing.

#### Servo Motor
- **Range from 0 to 180 Degrees**: Servo motors are capable of precise position control within a range of 0 to 180 degrees. They operate on pulse width modulation (PWM), where the width of the pulse dictates the angle to which the servo will turn. The servo's circuitry is designed to maintain its position stable until a new signal is received.

#### DC Motor
- **Operation According to Voltage**: DC motors turn at a speed proportional to the voltage applied to them. The fundamental operation of a DC motor is based on the principle that when a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a mechanical force. By varying the voltage, or by changing the magnetic field strength, the speed of the motor can be controlled.
